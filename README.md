### Key Enhancements
Curious about the differences between the default Helix and Minerva’s edited version? Our framework offers enhanced customization for developers, including a new "ranks" feature, which simplifies class management. Additionally, we’ve expanded configuration options and added unique features not found in the default Helix version. For a complete list of changes, please visit the [Differences](https://minerva-servers.com/helix/manual/70-differences/) page in our documentation.

### Learning Resources
To develop with the Helix framework, a solid understanding of Garry's Mod Lua is required. For those new to Lua, we recommend starting with the basics on the [Garry's Mod Wiki](https://wiki.facepunch.com/gmod/) before diving into schema development.

### Framework Support
We do not provide support for your own Framework Changes. However, if there are errors that you are CERTAIN are our mistake, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/Minerva-Servers/helix/issues) describing the issue and providing reproduction steps.
